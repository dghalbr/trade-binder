## Contributions

These are some Contribution Guidelines for those working on the project. This
is hosted publicly in GitHub, but isn't a library. Odds are no one will be 
interested in contributing other than a few developers who are a part of this
idea.

- Make Pull Requests to the dev branch.
- Write tests for any new code. Be thorough.
- Make good decisions. If we can do that then there shouldn't be any problems.

## About

some practice with ReactJS and also wanted to make an app that could be useful.
